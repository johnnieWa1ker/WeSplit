## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnieWa1ker/WeSplit.git
cd WeSplit
pod install
open WeSplit.xcodeproj.
```

## 🎉 Why am I building this?
1. I am very interested in the SwiftUI framework from Apple, I believe that after a while it will become quite powerful so that you can quickly make cool projects with it
1. I want to master the 100 Days SwiftUI marathon 🏃‍♂️
